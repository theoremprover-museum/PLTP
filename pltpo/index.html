Working from Moore's dissertation and the 1975 JACM paper, I produced a
version of PLTP in OCaml.  We call this <I>PLTP(O)</I> here and stress
that unlike PLTP(R) and PLTP(A), this system was not based on the original
source code but from descriptions of it.  Despite the care taken by Boyer and
Moore in writing those descriptions, I inevitably had to make some judgement
calls about the details of some of the techniques.  PLTP(O) instructions,
OCAML source code, tests, and proofs are available at
