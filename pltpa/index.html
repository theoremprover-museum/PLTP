<H2>Abstract</H2>

This directory contains a contemporary (2017) implementation of PLTP coded in the
applicative (functional) Common Lisp of ACL2.  We name this system
<I>PLTP(A)</I>.  PLTP(A) is <I>almost</I> a translation into ACL2 of the 14
September, 1973, listing of the POP-2 for PLTP.  We explain the differences
below.  The material here is organized as follows.  First we summarize the
main files posted here so you can (i) browse the ACL2 source code for
PLTP(A), (ii) inspect PLTP(A)'s standard proveall and JACM proveall, including
the output of PLTP(A) on those regression suites, and (iii) read our argument
that the two failures in its standard proveall do not indicate a discrepancy
between PLTP and PLTP(A).  Next, we describe the differences between the
original PLTP and PLTP(A).  The differences include bug fixes and some
``gratuitous'' changes to make the new code clearer.  Finally, we explain how
to get ACL2 and how to run PLTP(A).

a certain amount of infrastructure (e.g., the definition of the Common Lisp symbol package named
<CODE>"PLTP"</CODE>).  But if you merely want to see how PLTP(A) is coded in
ACL2 and what it can prove, browse here.

<H2>PLTP v PLTP(A)</H2>

<P>
The sources for The Edinburgh Pure Lisp Theorem Prover, aka PLTP, as of 14 September, 1973,
are in <A HREF="../scanned-images/Listing-F-OCR.pdf">Listing-F</A>
and <A HREF="../scanned-images/Listing-H-OCR.pdf">Listing-H</A>, and have been transcribed
into text form in
<A HREF="../listings-f-and-h/listings-f-and-h.txt">listings-f-and-h.txt</A>.

<P>

PLTP was written in 1972 and 1973.  It was
programmed in POP-2, a now dead imperative programming language, and ran on
an ICL 4130 processor with 64K bytes of 2 microsecond memory shared between 8
interactive jobs controlled by teletype input from the users.  File input and
output was by paper tape and lineprinter.
<P>
PLTP(A) is an applicative Common Lisp implementation of the PLTP proof
techniques and heuristics as of 14 September, 1973.  In fact, PLTP(A) is
coded in ACL2, a descendent of PLTP.  PLTP(A) is <I>not</I> a faithful
translation of the 1973 code because the known
<A HREF="../bugs/index.html">bugs and oddities</A> of PLTP's original code
have been repaired and some of the algorithms have been implemented
differently while preserving a high-level equivalency to the original code
as discussed further below.
<P>
PLTP(A) supports the same basic Pure Lisp as PLTP did, with
primitives <CODE>NIL</CODE>, <CODE>CAR</CODE>,
<CODE>CDR</CODE>, <CODE>CONS</CODE>, <CODE>EQUAL</CODE> and <CODE>IF</CODE>.
(Some versions of PLTP used the symbol <CODE>COND</CODE> instead
of <CODE>IF</CODE>.  PLTP(A) uses <CODE>IF</CODE> internally but defines
PLTP's 3-place <CODE>COND</CODE> to be <CODE>IF</CODE> and can optionally
print <CODE>IF</CODE>-expressions as
<CODE>COND</CODE>-expressions.)
<P>
PLTP(A) supports PLTP's abbreviation conventions of <CODE>T</CODE>
(denoting <CODE>(CONS NIL NIL)</CODE>) and natural numbers (denoting lists
of <CODE>NIL</CODE>).  PLTP's term representation left abbreviations in
place.  E.g., while exploring a term the 1973 theorem prover could have encountered both the number
<CODE>0</CODE> and its formal meaning, <CODE>NIL</CODE>.  This invited
programming errors, as when the 1973 <CODE>EVAL</CODE>
transformed <CODE>(CDR </CODE><I>n</I><CODE>)</CODE> to
<I>n</I>-1, for all natural numbers <I>n</I>, because we (Boyer and Moore)
forgot to check that <I>n</I> is not <CODE>0</CODE>, resulting in the
transformation of
<CODE>(CDR 0)</CODE> to the non-term <CODE>-1</CODE>.
<P>
In contrast, PLTP(A) translates abbreviated terms into their formal
correspondents at input so that the core theorem prover only sees formal
terms.  This not only makes its term exploration paradigms more regular but
eliminates a variety of bugs and oddities such as PLTP's failure to always
treat <CODE>T</CODE>, <CODE>1</CODE>, and <CODE>(CONS NIL NIL)</CODE> the
same even though all three denote the same term.
<P>
PLTP(A) ``untranslates'' before printing so printed terms contain the
familiar abbreviations.  This can be controlled by various ``feature switches'' set by
the user.  See the definition of <CODE>set-feature</CODE> in the PLTP(A) source code.

<P>
POP-2's 8-character limitation on names produced many obscure names, e.g.,
<CODE>GENRLT1</CODE>.  I have changed the names of many implementation functions, e.g.,
<CODE>GENRLT1</CODE> is here called <CODE>generalizable-subterms</CODE> and
<CODE>GENRLIZE</CODE> is now called <CODE>generalize</CODE>.  When the new
name lacks obvious correspondence to the old name (as
with <CODE>GENRLT1</CODE>), a comment in the code gives the old name.

<P>

PLTP(A) does not attempt to reproduce exactly PLTP's English explanations of the
proof steps.  (The main reason for this is that it requires cluttering the
code with output routines and for PLTP(A) I chose to make the generation of output as
inconspicuous as possible to focus on the clarity of the term manipulation
code.)  But PLTP(A) takes the same steps (subject to the caveats below),
describes each step in English, and prints the same intermediate formulas
(again, subject to caveats below).

<P>

No longer concerned with speed and memory footprint, I've freely recoded the
algorithms to return the ``same'' results, often by more elegant means.  But
by ``same'' I mean the proof steps taken by PLTP(A) are the same as those by
the 1973 PLTP.  Every intermediate formula produced by PLTP(A) logically
entails the corresponding formula produced by PLTP; in fact, if one allows
for variable renaming and abbreviations, corresponding formulas are usually
identical.  For example, where PLTP might have generated and printed
<PRE><CODE>
[COND [NUMBERP GENRL1] [EQUAL [LENGTH GENRL1] GENRL1] [CONS NIL NIL]]
</CODE></PRE>
PLTP(A) might generate and print the variant (due to variable renaming):
<PRE><CODE>
(COND (NUMBERP GENRL2) (EQUAL (LENGTH GENRL2) GENRL2) (CONS NIL NIL))
</CODE></PRE>
or one of several equivalent abbreviations for that formula depending on the feature switches:
<PRE><CODE>
(COND (NUMBERP GENRL2) (EQUAL (LENGTH GENRL2) GENRL2) T)
</CODE></PRE>
or
<PRE><CODE>
(IF (NUMBERP GENRL2) (EQUAL (LENGTH GENRL2) GENRL2) T)
</CODE></PRE>
or
<PRE><CODE>
(IMPLIES (NUMBERP GENRL2) (EQUAL (LENGTH GENRL2) GENRL2)).
</CODE></PRE>See the definition
of <CODE>set-feature</CODE> for more explanations.
<P>
But I wrote ``usually identical'' above!  There are two exceptions to this
formula-by-formula identity-modulo-abbreviations: the output of PLTP(A)'s
fertilization routine is a generalization of PLTP's, and the output of
PLTP(A)'s induction routine is always a list-based inductive formula and
never one tailored explicitly to Peano naturals.  We discuss these two
discrepancies, and some minor ones, below.

<P>

The important deviations from the implementation used in PLTP are as follows:

<UL>

<LI><I>Term Representation</I>:  As previously noted, the internal form of
terms in PLTP(A) is different:  abbreviations have been translated away.  This
changes the case analysis of virtually every routine that explores terms &mdash; and
eliminates several bugs.

<P>

<LI><I>Type information</I>: PLTP contained code to determine the ``type'' of
an expression.  In the most general case, it actually created a new function,
called the ``type function,'' to describe the output of a given function, <I>fn</I>.  Its
analysis was context free (insensitive both to the hypotheses governing the
occurrence of the call of <I>fn</I> in question and insensitive to the actuals passed to <I>fn</I>)
and was based on the type functions of the subfunctions used in the body of <I>fn</I>.  It
generated type functions on the fly during proofs, whenever it needed type information.
It then stored the generated type function on the property list of <I>fn</I> for future use.
Thus, PLTP 
routines that required type information side-effected the logical world.

<P>
I chose not to do this in PLTP(A) because it would have meant that every
term-processing routine in PLTP(A) that accessed type
information would have to return two results, the new term and the (possibly)
modified world containing updated type information.
<P>
Instead, every time the user introduces a function in PLTP(A), its type
function is generated then and there and stored.  This makes the prover
routines simpler and more valuable as pedagogical illustrations of the term
processing techniques.
<P>
Because PLTP's type function generator was context free, the type functions
generated by PLTP(A) at definition-time are the same as those PLTP generated
at proof-time.  (The above claim of equivalence is not entirely accurate
because of the next deviation!)

<P>

<LI><I>Numeric Variable Symbols</I>: PLTP, as of 14 September, 1973, provided
the notion of numerically typed variable symbols.  Recall that in PLTP's
logic, the naturals were constructed, Peano-like, from <CODE>NIL</CODE> by
successively <CODE>CONS</CODE>ing <CODE>NIL</CODE> onto them.  Such lists of
<CODE>NIL</CODE> were recognized by the predicate <CODE>NUMBERP</CODE>.
<P>
Variable symbols (which at the time we called
<I>Skolem constants</I>, from our days of resolution theorem proving) whose names
began with the letters between <CODE>I</CODE> and <CODE>N</CODE> were
understood to be numerically valued.  Such symbols were recognized by 
<CODE>ISNUMSKO</CODE> in the POP-2 source code for PLTP.  Theorems involving
such numeric variables were thought of as implicitly carrying additional
hypotheses constraining those variables to satisfy PLTP's <CODE>NUMBERP</CODE> predicate.
<P>
PLTP's type inference mechanism assumed any numeric variable was numerically valued.
Furthermore, it would infer and store the output type of a defined function from its body.
<P>
But this meant that <I>if</I> the PLTP user defined, say, the identity function with a numeric formal, PLTP would have
stored the type information that its output was numeric.  But PLTP did not provide any
enforcement of the implied type system!
<P>
For example the PLTP user could have written
<CODE>[DEFINE [FOO [LAMBDA [N] N]]]</CODE> and it would be typed as numeric.
Then, using the stored type function, PLTP could have proved the invalid formula <CODE>(NUMBERP (FOO A))</CODE>.
But nothing would prevent the PLTP user from then calling <CODE>FOO</CODE> on a
non-number and the result would be that non-number (since <CODE>FOO</CODE>
here is the identity function), contrary to the theorem just mentioned.

<P>
The PLTP user &mdash and there were only two! &mdash could avoid this
unsoundness simply by never using numeric variables as formals in
definitions.  Indeed, no definition in the standard regression suite or the
JACM paper used numeric formals, so perhaps we recognized this problem at the
time.  (It should be understood that PLTP was an experimental research tool
for investigations into induction and we tolerated many such implicit
preconditions so we could get on with the research.)
<P>
Numeric variables were also supported in induction: instead of proving
<CODE>[<I>p</I> N]</CODE> with its normal simple induction scheme for lists:
<PRE>
[AND [<I>p</I> NIL]
     [IMPLIES [<I>p</I> N] [<I>p</I> [CONS N1 N]]]]
</PRE>
PLTP used a scheme tailored to numerically typed variables:
<PRE>
[AND [<I>p</I> 0]
     [IMPLIES [<I>p</I> N] [<I>p</I> [ADD1 N]]]].
</PRE>
<I>aka</I>
<PRE>
[AND [<I>p</I> NIL]
     [IMPLIES [<I>p</I> N] [<I>p</I> [CONS NIL N]]]].
</PRE>
<P>
In creating PLTP(A), I therefore had the choice of either (a) enforcing a
type system or (b) removing the whole notion of numeric variables.  I chose the latter.
PLTP(A) does <I>not</I> treat variables starting with the
letters <CODE>I</CODE> through <CODE>N</CODE> any differently than other
variables and it never does a numeric induction.
<P>
Theorems in the two PLTP(A) provealls that contained numeric variables have been
modified here to carry explicit <CODE>NUMBERP</CODE> hypotheses.

<P>

<LI><I>Evaluation and Induction</I>: PLTP's <CODE>EVAL</CODE> used side
effects and about a dozen global variables to accumulate information to be
used by the induction heuristic, including a so-called ``bomb list'' for each
unexpanded recursive function call recording ``why'' that call could not be
expanded.  When PLTP needed to symbolically evaluate a term, it
called <CODE>EVAL</CODE> and ignored the side-effected globals; when PLTP
needed to induct, it called <CODE>EVAL</CODE> and ignored the result but
inspected the final value of the global <CODE>ANALYSIS</CODE> which contained
the bomb lists.
<P>
As with the code for type inference, mimicking this behavior in ACL2's
functional setting would have produced hard-to-comprehend code
because PLTP(A)'s functional <CODE>eval</CODE> would have to return both the simplified term and a
modified list of global variables.
<P>
Instead, I split PLTP's <CODE>EVAL</CODE> into two ACL2 functions, one for computing the result and another
for computing the side-effects.
The PLTP(A) <CODE>eval</CODE> does not accumulate anything on the side, making it easier to see how
PLTP did symbolic evaluation.
<P>
Then, to implement induction in PLTP(A), I re-construct the value of
PLTP's <CODE>ANALYSIS</CODE>, with a separate function,
called <CODE>induction-analysis</CODE>.  <CODE>Induction-analysis</CODE> makes it
clear what information induction uses.

<P>
While the 1973 PLTP implementation makes it obvious that induction is driven by
the ``failures'' of the symbolic evaluator, PLTP(A)'s implementation makes it
easier to understand how symbolic evaluation works and what information
induction uses.

<P>

<LI><I>Fertilization</I>: ``Fertilization'' was introduced in PLTP and
describes the idea of using an equality induction hypothesis by selective
substitution <I>and then throwing the hypothesis away</I>.  However, in an
effort to have our cake and eat it too, PLTP did not actually throw the
hypothesis away: it merely hid it.  It hid it by introducing a new function
symbol of no arguments that was ``defined'' to be the negation of the
equality and then disjoining a call of that new function to the formula
resulting from throwing away the equality.  This meant the output of the
fertilization routine was equivalent to the input, which in turn meant that
fertilization could freely recur root-and-branch through a formula fertilizing at will.

<P>

The problem with this approach is that it is that these new functions are not
proper definitions: their bodies involve variables not among their formals.
And if one extended the idea by adding those variables as formals to the new
symbols, they would block the subsequent inductions that PLTP did.

<P>
PLTP(A) avoids the on-the-fly introduction of dubious definitions by deleting
the equality after using it, which generalizes the formula.  This is what
NQTHM and ACL2 do.  But this means that PLTP(A) cannot recur freely through
the formula looking for equalities to use.  It only fertilizes conjuncts of
the top-level goal.

<P>
No published proof by PLTP required any
other form of fertilization.

<P>

<LI><I>New Variable Names</I>: As noted in <A HREF="../bugs/index.html">bugs
and oddities</A> PLTP made certain implicit assumptions on user input that
made it easier to generate ``new'' variable names by just taking on
successively higher suffixes.  While these implicit assumptions are never violated
in the known regression runs, I chose to eliminate that implicit assumption in PLTP(A)
and to generate variable names that are guaranteed to be new.  This means PLTP(A)
sometimes generates different variable names than PLTP did.
For example, in the proof of <CODE>[T 1 4]</CODE> (page 10 of <A HREF="../scanned-images/Listing-J-OCR.pdf">Listing J</A>)
we see PLTP generating the name <CODE>GENRL1</CODE> the first time it generalizes and then
generating <CODE>GENRL2</CODE> and <CODE>GENRL3</CODE> the second time.  But when PLTP(A) is given the
same conjecture to prove, it generates <CODE>GENRL1</CODE> the first time it generalizes and
<CODE>GENRL1</CODE> and <CODE>GENRL2</CODE> the second time <I>because the
previously generated <CODE>GENRL1</CODE> no longer appears in the conjecture
and so can be reused</I>.  While this discrepancy could be avoided, doing so
needlessly complicates the name generation algorithm because it would require
passing around the history of the proof attempt, not just the current goal.

<P>

<LI><I>Maximal Common Subterms</I>: PLTP used fairly messy code to find the largest
common subterms on opposites sides of equalities and implications; PLTP(A),
on the other hand, just computes all the subterms of the two sides,
intersects them, and then throws out any subterm contained in another.
Whether this algorithm returns the list in the same order &mdash; or even whether
the original algorithm really returned the alleged list of ``largest common
subterms'' &mdash; is irrelevant here: PLTP(A)'s algorithm returns a list of the
largest common subterms, its correctness is obvious, speed is irrelevant
given the small problem size and today's resources, and the order of the
subterms shouldn't matter because all of them are then generalized to new
variables.  If the subterms are listed in a different order then that will
affect the names of the new variables assigned to each, giving rise to the
``variable renaming'' caveat above.  But that shouldn't affect the proofs.

<P>

<LI><I>The ``Waterfall''</I>: I refactored PLTP's main proof
routine, <CODE>PROVE1</CODE> to better expose what became <I>the
waterfall</I> in our subsequent provers.
<P>
PLTP's <CODE>PROVE1</CODE> explicitly
called <CODE>EVALUATE</CODE> (which is just <CODE>EVAL</CODE> after initializing the
globals used to accumulate induction analysis), <CODE>REWRITE</CODE>, and
<CODE>REDUCE</CODE> successively and looped until the result stablized.  While this
process was called ``normalation'' in the 14 September, 1973, PLTP, in
subsequent versions of PLTP and our other provers the comparable process was called <I>simplification</I>.
<P>
Once the formula was simplified, PLTP called a routine that Boyer and I
facetiously named <CODE>ARTIFINTEL</CODE> (for ``artificial intelligence''
because according to a comment in the POP-2 code it was <CODE>THE SMARTEST
PROGRAM IN THE THEOREM PROVER</CODE> because it only works on the first
conjunct).  <CODE>ARTIFINTEL</CODE> fertilized, generalized, and inducted on
the first conjunct in the formula it was given.  PLTP did not support
elimination of destructors or of irrelevance, which were introduced later.
<P>
In PLTP(A), I wrap
the <CODE>EVALUATE</CODE>/<CODE>REWRITE</CODE>/<CODE>REDUCE</CODE> loop up
into a single function named <CODE>simplify</CODE>, and I just
open-code <CODE>ARTIFINTEL</CODE>
so <CODE>fertilize</CODE>, <CODE>generalize</CODE>, and <CODE>induct</CODE>
are called explicitly by <CODE>prove1</CODE>.
<P>
PLTP(A) preserves PLTP's use of a single formula to represent the problem.
For example, if simplification splits the problem into two subgoals, the
result is an <CODE>IF</CODE>-expression representing their conjunction and
fertilize, etc., just work on one conjunct at a time.  It wasn't until NQTHM
that Boyer and I started splitting out goals as clauses collected and
implicitly conjoined in the <I>pool</I> at the bottom of the waterfall.
<P>

</UL>

In PLTP's defense (not to mention that of Boyer and me!) I should note that
the resource limitations of the 1970's ICL 4130 and the POP-2 compiler
probably drove many of our implementation choices and coding style.  It
wasn't until 1989 and ACL2 that we adopted the much cleaner functional
programming style.  And that style alone does not guarantee clarity.  Indeed,
ACL2 today contains many less-than-elegant functional algorithms because
performance still often demands code optimization despite the enormous
improvement in processor speeds and memory sizes because applications have
grown so much larger.  Indeed, ACL2 supports functions that return a vector
of values so that in one sweep of a huge formula many things can be
accumulated.

<P>
The small sizes of the definitions and conjectures presented to PLTP was
wonderfully freeing given today's resources!

<P>
The changes in implementation also reflect lessons learned from 45 years of
coding provers together with the much more robust ACL2 programming
environment I enjoy today.
<P>

<H2>Running PLTP(A)</H2>
<A NAME="RunningPLTPA">

PLTP(A) was added to ACL2's Community Books Repository in March, 2018.  So if
you have a recent ACL2 installation, you already have PLTP(A).  Below we tell
you how to run it.  After that we give a brief summary of the interesting
files you'll find on the <CODE>books/projects/pltpa/</CODE> subdirectory of
your ACL2 directory, and finally we tell you how to get ACL2 if you don't
have it.

<P>
To play with PLTP(A), do

<PRE>
(include-book "projects/pltpa/pltpa" :dir :system)
</PRE>

and then select the PLTP symbol package and initialize the PLTP(A) logical world with

<PRE>
(pltpa)
</PRE>

Then you can define PLTP functions and submit challenge theorems as with

<PRE>
(define (append ; define a PLTP function
	 (lambda (x y)
	   (if x (cons (car x) (append (cdr x) y)) y))))

(prove assoc-of-append ; name is irrelevant except for io; theorems are not
                       ; stored in the PLTP world

       (equal (append (append a b) c)
              (append a (append b c))))
</PRE>
For a complete list of available commands, e.g., to inspect PLTP's database,
or undo a definition, see the comment at the top of the
<A HREF="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acl2/acl2/master/books/projects/pltpa/pltpa.lisp">PLTP(A)
source file</A>, which may be found
in <CODE>"books/projects/pltpa/pltpa.lisp"</CODE> of your local ACL2
installation.
<P>
You can find all of the PLTP(A) files on the <CODE>books/projects/pltpa/</CODE>
subdirectory of your ACL2 directory.

<P>
Among the interesting files after certification of the books there you will find:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>pltpa.lisp</CODE> &mdash; the source file for PLTP(A)
<LI><CODE>pltpa.acl2</CODE> &mdash; the definition of the PLTP symbol package
<LI><CODE>standard-proveall.lsp</CODE> &mdash; the PLTP(A) commands in its standard proveall regression suite
<LI><CODE>chk-standard-proveall.lisp</CODE> &mdash; an ACL2 book that is certifiable iff PLTP(A) passes the standard proveall
<LI><CODE>chk-standard-proveall.cert.out</CODE> &mdash; PLTP(A)'s output on the standard proveall (see note below)
<LI><CODE>jacm-proveall.lsp</CODE> &mdash; the PLTP(A) commands in its JACM proveall regression suite
<LI><CODE>chk-jacm-proveall.lisp</CODE> &mdash; an ACL2 book that is certifiable iff PLTP(A) passes the JACM proveall
<LI><CODE>chk-jacm-proveall.cert.out</CODE> &mdash; PLTP(A)'s output on the JACM proveall (see note below)
</UL>

Note on how to read the <CODE>.cert.out</CODE> files above: Ordinarily, an
ACL2 book can be certified provided the ACL2 prover can successfully prove
every theorem in it.  So how do we make a book that ACL2 can certify iff
PLTP(A) can prove the theorems in its own regression?  That involves a
certain amount of infrastructure.  The two <CODE>.cert.out</CODE> files above
contain the output of ACL2's certification process.  That output starts and
ends with ``noise'' related to ACL2's certification infrastructure.
PLTP(A)'s output (e.g., on its standard proveall) may be found between the
block of text that starts with

<PRE>
:STANDARD Proveall by PLTP(A)
</PRE>
and the block that starts with
<PRE>
Successful :STANDARD Proveall by PLTP(A) completed on
</PRE>

Of course, if you have a running PLTP(A) you can see the output of the
provealls by evaluating <CODE>(proveall :standard)</CODE> and <CODE>(proveall
:jacm)</CODE>.


<P>
If you do not already have ACL2 then you must obtain and install it in order
to run PLTP(A).  This also involves installing one of several available
Common Lisp implementations.  Follow the installation instructions under
the <I>Obtaining, Installing, and License</I> link on the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2">ACL2 Home Page</A>.
<P>
The <I>Easy Install for Unix-like Systems</I> instructions will fetch not
only the ACL2 system source code but also all of the Community Books.  It is
easier to fetch them all than to fetch just what you need for PLTP(A).  But
because PLTP(A) does not depend on any other books, you can skip the general
certification instructions (e.g., Step 5 of the <I>Easy Install for Unix-like
Systems</I>) if all you want to do is play with PLTP(A).  Instead, just build your
<CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> runnable image and then certify the PLTP(A) books by
connecting to <CODE>books/projects/pltpa</CODE> in your local ACL2
installation and running:
<PRE>
../../build/cert.pl --acl2 ../../../saved_acl2 *.lisp
</PRE>
